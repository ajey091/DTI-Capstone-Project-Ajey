# DTI-Capstone-Project-Ajey
This is my capstone project for the DTI seminalist phase. 

My project is about analyzing patterns in traffic violation data from the state of New York between the years 2013 and 2016. The data analysis code is written in Python and is mainly based on the Pandas library.
